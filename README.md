## Real-Time Features

### ðŸš€ WebSocket Integration
The application includes comprehensive real-time functionality:

- **Live Task Updates**: Status changes, assignments, and modifications broadcast instantly
- **Real-Time Comments**: New comments appear instantly with mention notifications
- **Live Notifications**: Task assignments, status changes, and deadline reminders
- **Admin Dashboard Monitoring**: Real-time user activity and system statistics
- **Live Activity Feed**: System-wide events and collaboration awareness

### ðŸ“¡ WebSocket Architecture
- **Backend**: NestJS WebSocket gateways with JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: React WebSocket context with custom hooks
- **Events**: Task updates, comments, notifications, and admin monitoring
- **Security**: Room-based subscriptions with proper authorization

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd task-manager-backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Start the backend:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
- API: http://localhost:3000
- WebSocket: ws://localhost:3000/tasks
- Swagger docs: http://localhost:3000/api

---

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd task-manager-frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
REACT_APP_ENV=development
```


Start the frontend:
```bash
npm start
```
- App: http://localhost:3001 (or as configured)

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank screen after update:** Check browser console for errors, ensure backend is running.
- **API 500 errors:** Check backend logs for stack traces.
- **MongoDB connection issues:** Verify your `MONGODB_URI` and database status.
- **Redux state issues:** Check Redux DevTools for state updates and actions.
- **WebSocket connection issues:** Check CORS configuration and JWT token validity.
- **Real-time events not working:** Verify WebSocket connection status and room subscriptions.
